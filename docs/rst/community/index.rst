Community Information & Contributing
====================================

Ansible Container is an open source project designed to bring together developers of all kinds to collaborate on creating
a better way to build, test, and deploy containers.

Should you wish to get more involved, whether in terms of just asking a question, helping other users, introducing new people
to Ansible Container, or contributing code or documentation, we welcome your contributions!

.. _ask_a_question:

I've got a question
-------------------

We're happy to help!

Questions are best asked on the `Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-container>`_.

When asking a question please be sure to share any relevant commands you ran, output, the version of Ansible Container you are using, etc.
Where needed, link to gists or GitHub repos to show examples, rather than sending attachments to the list.

Alternatively, you can also join our IRC channel, #ansible-container on irc.freenode.net.

I’d Like To Keep Up With Release Announcements
----------------------------------------------
Release announcements will be posted to the `Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-container>`_.

I’d Like To Help Share and Promote Ansible Container
----------------------------------------------------
You can help share Ansible Container with others by telling friends and colleagues, writing a blog post, or presenting at user groups and
`meetups <https://www.meetup.com>`_.

You are also welcome to share slides on `speakerdeck <https://speakerdeck.com/>`_, sign up for a free account and tag it “Ansible”. On Twitter, share things
with #ansible, and follow `@ansible <https://twitter.com/ansible>`_.

I’d Like To Help Ansible Container Move Faster
----------------------------------------------
If you’re a developer, one of the most valuable things you can do is review the `open issues list on GitHub <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues>`_, and
fix bugs. We almost always prioritize bug fixing over feature development, so closing bugs is very helpful.

Testing and opening issues is a huge help, and something we can all do. Hopefully you are using Ansible Container to manage containers
in your environment. Please, take the time to `open an issue <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/new>`_ whenever you encounter
a bug, see something that doesn't make sense, or think of a feature we should consider.

I’d Like To Report A Bug
------------------------
The most helpful way to report a bug is by `opening an issue <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/issues/new>`_ at the Ansible Container repo.
When opening an issue you will see a template prompting you for information. Please provide as much detail as possible, keeping in mind that the goal is to
help a developer reproduce the bug. The template asks about your environment, the command you executed, stacktraces, etc. Feel free to
include links to gists, links to screenshots, and anything you feel will help a developer reproduce and troubleshoot the problem.

I’d Like To Help With Documentation
-----------------------------------
Documentation is a community project too!

If you would like to help with the documentation, whether correcting a typo or improving a section, or maybe even documenting a new feature, submit a
pull request with changes to the *.rst* documents found in the *docs/rst* subdirectory of the project.

Contributing Code
-----------------
Code contributions are accepted via GitHub pull request (PR).

We recommend joining the `Ansible Container Mailing List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-container>`_ and starting a topic for any large
features prior to submitting a PR. This especially helps avoid duplicate work or eliminating situations where reviewers decide, upon seeing your submission
for the first time, that more than cosmetic revisions are needed.

We reserve the right to reject submissions that are not a good fit for the project or not in keeping with the intended direction of the project. If you are
unclear as to whether a feature is a good fit, take the time to start a discussion on the mailing list.

Observing the following will make the review process smoother and increase the likelihood of acceptance:

- Limit the scope of a submission to a single feature or a single bug fix
- Explain the use case
- Provide examples
- Provide documentation for new features
- Include unit and integration tests
- Associate your PR with an open issue or an item on the roadmap
- Follow the `contributors guide <https://github.com/ansible/ansible-container/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTORS.md>`_

Community Code of Conduct
`````````````````````````

Every community can be strengthened by a diverse variety of viewpoints, insights, opinions, skill sets, and skill levels. However, with diversity comes the potential for disagreement and
miscommunication. The purpose of this Code of Conduct is to ensure that disagreements and differences of opinion are conducted respectfully and on their own merits, without personal attacks
or other behavior that might create an unsafe or unwelcoming environment.

These policies are not designed to be a comprehensive set of *Things You Cannot Do*. We ask that you treat your fellow community members with respect and courtesy, and in general, *Don’t Be
A Jerk*. This Code of Conduct is meant to be followed in spirit as much as in letter, and is not exhaustive.

All Ansible events and participants therein are governed by this Code of Conduct and anti-harassment policy. We expect organizers to enforce these guidelines throughout all events,
and we expect attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers to help ensure a safe environment for our whole community. Specifically, this Code of Conduct covers participation in all
Ansible-related forums and mailing lists, code and documentation contributions, public IRC channels, private correspondence, and public meetings.

Ansible Container community members are...

**Considerate**

Contributions of every kind have far-ranging consequences. Just as your work depends on the work of others, decisions you make surrounding your contributions to the Ansible Container 
community will affect your fellow community members. You are strongly encouraged to take those consequences into account while making decisions.

**Patient**

Asynchronous communication can come with its own frustrations, even in the most responsive of communities. Please remember that our community is largely built on volunteered time,
and that questions, contributions, and requests for support may take some time to receive a response. Repeated “bumps” or “reminders” in rapid succession are not good displays of patience.
Additionally, it is considered poor manners to ping a specific person with general questions. Pose your question to the community as a whole, and wait patiently for a response.

**Respectful**

Every community inevitably has disagreements, but remember that it is possible to disagree respectfully and courteously. Disagreements are never an excuse for rudeness, hostility, threatening
behavior, abuse (verbal or physical), or personal attacks.

**Kind**

Everyone should feel welcome in the Ansible Container community, regardless of their background. Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. Do not make or post
offensive comments related to skill level, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. Sexualized images or imagery,
real or implied violence, intimidation, oppression, stalking, sustained disruption of activities, publishing the personal information of others without explicit permission to do so, unwanted
physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention are all strictly prohibited. Additionally, you are encouraged not to make assumptions about the background or identity of your fellow community
members.

**Inquisitive**

The only stupid question is the one that does not get asked. We encourage our users to ask early, and ask often. Rather than asking whether you can ask a question (the answer is always yes!),
instead, simply ask your question. You are encouraged to provide as many specifics as possible. Code snippets in the form of Gists or other paste site links are almost always needed in order
to get the most helpful answers. Refrain from pasting multiple lines of code directly into the IRC channel - instead use `gist.github.com <https://gist.github.com>`_ or another paste site
to provide code snippets.

**Helpful**

The Ansible Container community is committed to being a welcoming environment for all users, regardless of skill level. We were all beginners once upon a time, and our community cannot grow
without an environment where new users feel safe and comfortable asking questions. It can become frustrating to answer the same questions repeatedly; however, community members are expected
to remain courteous and helpful to all users equally, regardless of skill or knowledge level. Avoid providing responses that prioritize snideness and snark over useful information. At the same
time, everyone is expected to read the provided documentation thoroughly. We are happy to answer questions, provide strategic guidance, and suggest effective workflows, but we are not here to do
your job for you.

Anti-harassment policy
``````````````````````
Harassment includes (but is not limited to) all of the following behaviors:

- Offensive comments related to gender (including gender expression and identity), age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, and religion
- Derogatory terminology including words commonly known to be slurs
- Posting sexualized images or imagery in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation
- Stalking
- Posting others’ personal information without explicit permission
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized
images, activities, or other material. Meetup organizing staff and other volunteer organizers should not use sexualized attire or otherwise create a sexualized environment at community events.

In addition to the behaviors outlined above, continuing to behave a certain way after you have been asked to stop also constitutes harassment, even if that behavior is not specifically outlined
in this policy. It is considerate and respectful to stop doing something after you have been asked to stop, and all community members are expected to comply with such requests immediately.

Policy violations
-----------------
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting greg@ansible.com, to any channel operator in the community IRC channel, or to 
local organizers of an event. Meetup organizers are encouraged to prominently display points of contact for reporting unacceptable behavior at local events.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate. These actions may include but are not limited to warning the offender,
expelling the offender from the event, and barring the offender from future community events.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts to an alternate location, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to
feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value the safety and well-being of our community members and want everyone to feel welcome at our events, both online and offline.

We expect all participants, organizers, speakers, and attendees to follow these policies at our all of our event venues and event-related social events.
